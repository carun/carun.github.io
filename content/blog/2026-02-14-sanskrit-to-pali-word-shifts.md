Here is a concise map of major sound changes from Old Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit) -> Middle Indo-Aryan (Pāḷi).

# Consonant Cluster Simplification (Biggest Change)

Middle Indo-Aryan strongly simplifies clusters.

### 1. Stop + Stop -> Geminate

| Sanskrit   | Meaning       | Pāḷi       | Meaning            |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| **dharma** | law, doctrine | **dhamma** | teaching, doctrine |
| **karma**  | action        | **kamma**  | action, deed       |
| **sapta**  | seven         | **satta**  | seven              |

Rule (simplified): r + consonant often disappears; cluster becomes doubled consonant.


### 2. dhy -> jh

| Sanskrit      | Meaning            | Pāḷi          | Meaning               |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | --------------------- |
| **dhyāna**    | meditation         | **jhāna**     | meditative absorption |
| **dhyāyati**  | meditates          | **jhāyati**   | meditates             |
| **upādhyāya** | preceptor, teacher | **upajjhāya** | monastic preceptor    |


### 3. jñ -> ññ / ñā

| Sanskrit  | Meaning         | Pāḷi     | Meaning                            |
| --------- | --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **jñāna** | knowledge       | **ñāṇa** | knowledge, insight                 |
| **ajña**  | ignorant person | **añña** | ignorant; "other" (by development) |


### 4. kṣ -> kkh / kh

| Sanskrit   | Meaning               | Pāḷi       | Meaning             |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| **kṣetra** | field                 | **khetta** | field               |
| **kṣānti** | patience, forbearance | **khanti** | patience, endurance |


# Loss of `r` in Clusters

Sanskrit *r* in clusters often disappears and causes doubling:

| Sanskrit    | Meaning      | Pāḷi       | Meaning           |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
| **karma**   | action       | **kamma**  | action            |
| **varṇa**   | color, class | **vaṇṇa**  | color, appearance |
| **śraddhā** | faith        | **saddhā** | faith, confidence |


# Assimilation & Gemination

Clusters assimilate to nearby sounds:

| Sanskrit   | Meaning            | Pāḷi      | Meaning            |
| ---------- | ------------------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| **satya**  | truth              | **sacca** | truth              |
| **tattva** | principle, reality | **tatta** | that-ness; reality |


# Sibilant Simplification

Sanskrit has 3 sibilants (ś ṣ s).
Pāḷi reduces them mostly to **s**.

| Sanskrit    | Meaning       | Pāḷi       | Meaning      |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| **śīla**    | moral conduct | **sīla**   | moral virtue |
| **śraddhā** | faith         | **saddhā** | faith        |


# Vowel Changes

Less dramatic than consonants, but:

* ai -> e
* au -> o

| Sanskrit    | Meaning         | Pāḷi       | Meaning         |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **maitrī**  | loving-kindness | **mettā**  | loving-kindness |
| **gaurava** | weight, respect | **garava** | respect         |


# Aspiration Often Preserved

Unlike later Prakrits, Pāḷi often keeps aspiration:

| Sanskrit   | Meaning           | Pāḷi        | Meaning                       |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| **bhikṣu** | mendicant, monk   | **bhikkhu** | Buddhist monk                 |
| **buddha** | awakened one      | **buddha**  | the awakened one              |
| **duḥkha** | suffering, pain   | **dukkha**  | suffering, unsatisfactoriness |
| **laghu**  | light (in weight) | **lahu**    | light, swift                  |


# Big Picture

Old Indo-Aryan -> Middle Indo-Aryan (Pāḷi) shifts:

* Complex clusters -> simplified
* r in clusters -> lost + doubling
* dhy -> jh
* jñ -> ññ
* kṣ -> kkh/kh
* Three sibilants -> mostly one (s)
* Diphthongs simplified

Pāḷi is therefore **phonologically simpler and more regular** than classical Sanskrit.
