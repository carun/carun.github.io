For consciousness, to fully understand itself, it has to go through a paradox.
It must forget itself. Here's why: Consciousness in its purest form is infinite.
It has no boundaries, no contrast, no separation, just limitless existence, but
here's the problem.

If something is everything, how can it truly know itself? If there is nothing
outside of it -- no contrast, no differentiation, then there is nothing to compare
itself to. Nothing to experience itself against. It's like trying to see your own
face without a mirror.

So what does the infinite consciousness do? It creates experiences, constructs an
illusions of separation so that it can interact with itself. It fragments into
different perspectives, different beings, different realities. Also that it can
experience itself in ways it never could, as a singular, all-knowing entity. But
in order for those experiences to feel real, it has to **forget** that it created them.

Think about playing a game or watching a movie. If you knew exactly how everything
would unfold - every twist, every ending, you wouldn't be fully immersed. The joy
of the experience comes from believing in the moment that it's real. Even if, on some
level, you know it's just a game or a story. In the same way, consciousness has to
create a deep convincing illusion, **a reality so immersive**, that it can actually
forget it's the creator. That's what this reality is - you, me and everyone - we
are consciousness experiencing itself through these limited perspectives. :-)

And because we have forgotten our infinite nature, we get to explore, learn, struggle,
love and rediscover ourselves in ways that wouldn't be possible if we already knew
everything. The process of awakening is when consciousness starts to lift the veil
to remember, it's when we start questioning: Who am I really, where did I come from?
What is this world?

Such questions lead us back to the realization that we were never separate after all.
The forgetting was just part of the journey so that the remembering could be meaningful.

In short, forgetting creates contrast. Contrast creates experience. Experience creates
understanding and through this cycle, consciousness deepens its own self-awareness over
and over, forever!
