It is surely a blessing that dreams do not instantly come true. For if your dreams were to immediately be fulfilled, you
would never have the pleasure of dreaming them. The anticipation of an achievement is an important part of the value of
that achievement. Having something to look forward to gives enormous richness to life.

It is good to achieve your dreams, and yet it is also good to hold on to them, to nurture, refine and appreciate them
before they have been reached. In so doing, by the time the dream is achieved, it has developed a real and profound
meaning.Working toward a goal is what makes that goal worth having. The fact that a dream has not yet been fully
realized is what makes that dream so enticingly desirable.

Go ahead and dream big, wonderful, positive and intimately meaningful dreams. For they're the ones that will get you to
move diligently and persistently forward. Your dreams will not come true in an instant, yet they can instantly begin to
provide focus, direction, and a driving force. You can then enjoy each and every moment as you steadily bring those
dreams to life.
