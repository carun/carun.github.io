A compact map of Sanskrit to Prakrit (general Middle Indo-Aryan), parallel to the Pāḷi one.

Prakrit varies by region: Śaurasenī, Māgadhī, Mahārāṣṭrī — but these are the common tendencies.

# Consonant Cluster Simplification (Even Stronger than Pāḷi)

## 1. r in Clusters Often Disappears

| Sanskrit   | Meaning       | Prakrit    | Meaning  |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| **karma**  | action        | **kamma**  | action   |
| **dharma** | law, doctrine | **dhamma** | doctrine |
| **varṇa**  | color, class  | **vaṇṇa**  | color    |

Same pattern as Pāḷi; this is a core Middle Indo-Aryan development.

## 2. kṣ -> kk / kh / kkh

| Sanskrit   | Meaning  | Prakrit            | Meaning  |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| **kṣetra** | field    | **khetta / ketta** | field    |
| **kṣānti** | patience | **khanti**         | patience |

## 3. jñ -> ññ / ṇṇ / ñ

| Sanskrit  | Meaning   | Prakrit         | Meaning   |
| --------- | --------- | --------------- | --------- |
| **jñāna** | knowledge | **ñāṇa**        | knowledge |
| **ajña**  | ignorant  | **aṇṇa / añña** | ignorant  |

---

# dhy -> jh (Like Pāḷi)

| Sanskrit     | Meaning    | Prakrit         | Meaning    |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| **dhyāna**   | meditation | **jhāṇa**       | meditation |
| **dhyāyati** | meditates  | **jhāi / jhāe** | meditates  |

This is a general Middle Indo-Aryan development.

# Loss of Final Consonants (Very Strong in Prakrit)

Prakrit often drops final consonants more aggressively than Pāḷi.

| Sanskrit  | Meaning | Prakrit        | Meaning |
| --------- | ------- | -------------- | ------- |
| **sat**   | being   | **sa**         | being   |
| **lokas** | world   | **logo / loe** | world   |

---

# Intervocalic Stop Weakening

Between vowels, stops may weaken or disappear.

| Sanskrit   | Meaning | Prakrit             | Meaning |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| **loka**   | world   | **loa / loga**      | world   |
| **nagara** | city    | **nagara / nayara** | city    |

This is stronger in some Prakrits than in Pāḷi.

# Sibilants Collapse

Sanskrit ś ṣ s -> usually **s** (sometimes h in Māgadhī-type dialects)

| Sanskrit | Meaning    | Prakrit      | Meaning    |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| **śiva** | auspicious | **siva**     | auspicious |
| **ṣaṭ**  | six        | **cha / sa** | six        |

---

# Diphthong Simplification

| Sanskrit    | Meaning         | Prakrit    | Meaning         |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **maitrī**  | loving-kindness | **metti**  | loving-kindness |
| **gaurava** | respect         | **garava** | respect         |

ai -> e
au -> o

---

# Aspirates Often Weaken (More than in Pāḷi)

In some Prakrits:

* bh -> b
* dh -> d
* gh -> g

| Sanskrit    | Meaning | Prakrit                     | Meaning |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| **bhavati** | becomes | **hoti / bavi** (dialectal) | becomes |
| **laghu**   | light   | **lahu**                    | light   |

Pāḷi preserves aspiration more consistently than many literary Prakrits.

# Big Picture: Sanskrit -> Prakrit vs Pāḷi

| Feature                | Pāḷi              | Literary Prakrit |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Cluster simplification | strong            | very strong      |
| Final consonant loss   | moderate          | strong           |
| Aspiration             | often preserved   | often weakened   |
| r in clusters          | lost + gemination | same             |
| dhy -> jh              | yes               | yes              |

### Structural Trend

Old Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit)
-> Middle Indo-Aryan (Pāḷi, Prakrits)
-> New Indo-Aryan (Hindi, Bengali, etc.)

The overall direction is:

* Complex -> simpler
* Clusters -> doubled consonants or single consonants
* Distinctions -> merged
* Final consonants -> dropped
