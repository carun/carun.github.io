title: "A Game of Observation"
---

I used to think people could be broadly divided into two categories:

* **Thinkers**
* **Doers**

If you belong to one group, you may naturally gravitate toward the other during your downtime, seeking relaxation through a change of pace. A thinker might enjoy gardening, while a doer might unwind with a book. At first, switching roles can feel refreshing and even exciting. But over time, both thinking and doing can become mentally exhausting.

Today, I want to introduce a third category, one that's often known, yet rarely explored: the **Fully Aware Observer**. Let's call them simply **observers**.

This is a category of people who simply observe what's happening, without judgment, without craving or aversion. They witness phenomena arise and pass away, like a mirror reflecting everything yet clinging to nothing. Observers live in awareness of the moment, noticing experiences as they unfold, not interfering, not reacting.

This is the core of **Vipassana** meditation, a technique of mindful observation.

## The Observation Algorithm

Here's how this game of observation works:

1. **Anchor your attention on the abdomen.**
   As you breathe naturally, the abdomen rises and falls. These movements are the **primary objects** of observation. They are mutually exclusive, when one is happening, the other is not. Observe each movement carefully, and mentally label them: *rising* and *falling*.

    - In the beginning, verbal labeling helps build the habit. But as perception sharpens, words fade, and pure observation remains.

2. **Observe each object from beginning to end.**
   Don't miss even a fraction of the experience. Observe with full energy and precision.

3. **Other objects will arise, thoughts, sensations, sounds. Label them, then return to the primary object.**
   Here are some common intrusions:
    - A song pops into your mind ,  label it **thinking**.
    - An itch arises ,  label it **feeling**.
    - Back pain ,  label it **feeling**.
    - Planning tomorrow's tasks ,  label it **planning**.
    - A plane flies overhead ,  label it **hearing**.
    - If you forget to label and get lost in a stream of thoughts, once you realize it, label it **wandering**.

    This is why we choose a physical body sensation (like the abdomen) as the anchor, it's non-anticipatory, effortless, and always present.

4. **Label objects from all six sense doors, sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and thought. Then gently return to the rising and falling.**

5. **Remain still. Don't move a muscle.**
   This might be difficult at first, but stillness is vital. When the body moves, the mind moves. Stillness sharpens attention.

## Dealing with Pain

If physical pain arises (e.g., knee pain, back pain), observe it without judgment, don't label it as good or bad. Watch it like any other object. Most pains subside in 10-15 minutes.

If the pain becomes overwhelming or poses a risk of injury (due to pre-existing conditions, for example), change your posture mindfully. Maintain your awareness during the shift, make sure the pain doesn't dominate your attention. Otherwise, remain still and observe.

## Why This Practice Works

As you repeat this technique, mindfulness deepens. The distractions lose their power, and your ability to stay with the primary object strengthens.

This non-judgmental, clear, and calm observation rewires your mental habits. You become less reactive, more aware, and better equipped to handle distractions. The mind becomes a trained observer, labeling thoughts and returning to what matters.

Over time, this game of observation spills into daily life, making the mind sharper, calmer, and healthier. It's mindfulness in action, and best of all, it's non-dogmatic. It belongs to no religion or belief system.

## A Game with Characters

Treat it like a game. Watch out for these characters:

- **Closest Enemies**:
  *Sloth and torpor*, which show up as drowsiness or dullness.
  - **Antidote**: Sharpen your attention. Be precise and accurate in observing the rising and falling.

- **Closest Friends**:
  *Body pain*. Believe it or not, this is your friend.
  - **Why?** Because it anchors your attention and strengthens concentration.

- **Big Challenge**:
  Stay perfectly still. Don't move a muscle.

- **Other Characters**:
  Anything arising from the six sense bases. Label them, and return to the breath. That's all the attention they deserve.

This is **Vipassana** , a game of pure observation. No winners, no losers, only a growing awareness, moment by moment.

Feel fresh. Feel light. Just observe.
