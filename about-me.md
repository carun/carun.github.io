I work as a Director of Software Engineering at [Paravision AI](https://www.paravision.ai/) in California.

In my precious spare time I'm mostly doing stuff involving C/C++, D, Java, Kotlin and whatever strikes me fancy.

I'm originally from [Salem, Tamil Nadu, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Tamil_Nadu).  I live in Folsom,
California. I received my B.E. in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Bharathiar University in 2004 and I
received my M.S. in Communications Engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in 2009.  I've worked in
various functional domains ranging from automated betting, investment banking, digital signage and biometrics.
