I am a software engineer predominantly architecting, designing and developing low latency and high througput software
applications.  I work with [NEC Corporation of America](https://www.necam.com/) in California.

In my precious spare time I'm mostly doing stuff involving C/C++, D, Java and whatever strikes my fancy.

I'm originally from [Salem, Tamil Nadu, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Tamil_Nadu).  I live in Folsom,
California. I received my B.E. in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Bharathiar University in 2004 and I
received my M.S. in Communications Engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in 2009.  I've worked in
various functional domains ranging from automated betting, investment banking, digital signage and biometrics.  I've
been working with NEC since 2010 where I've played an instrumental role in projects such as UIDAI Aadhaar.  Few of the
products I've architected and developed are NEC Enterprise Video Analytics,
[AIM-XM](https://www.necam.com/AdvancedRecognitionSystems/Products/AIMXM/),
[AIM-ES](https://www.necam.com/AdvancedRecognitionSystems/Products/AIMES), [NeoFace
