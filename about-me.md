I work as a Director of Software Engineering at [NEC America](https://www.necam.com/) in California.

In my precious spare time I'm mostly doing stuff involving C/C++, D, Java, Kotlin and whatever strikes me fancy.

I'm originally from [Salem, Tamil Nadu, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Tamil_Nadu).  I live in Folsom,
California. I've worked in various functional domains ranging from automated betting, investment banking, digital
signage, biometrics, ML/AI, mobile, edge and extremely large scale systems.
